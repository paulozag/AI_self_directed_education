# AI_self_directed_education

### Purpose:
I am setting this repo up as a guide/repository of information for the goal of bootstrapping an education in Computer Science with an emphasis in machine learning/deep neural nets.

###Background:
I am a graduate of DBC (a web development bootcamp located in San Francisco).  I have no other formal education in the field of computer science other than some basic junior college classes in discrete math, data structures, and basic algorithm design.  I am sorely lacking in my math skills (basic calculus, 20 years ago) and lack a lot of the basic understandings of computer architecture and theory that one might take for granted had they formally studied computer science.

###Dilemma:
With regard to my understanding of computer science I currently reside in the 'first house of knowledge': namely, that I don't yet know what I don't know.  I'm currently slogging through as many sources as I can, gaining some perspective on what I am ignorant of, and trying to systemitize/generate some structure of what I need to study and the best order in which to tackle the material.
